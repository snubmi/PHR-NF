## Abstract
The class imbalance problem in Personal Health Records (PHRs) limits performance when analyzing such data using machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we developed a conditional normalizing flow algorithm with semi-supervised anomaly detection. We compared our novel approach with Light Gradient Boosting Machine, which is widely used in classification tasks, and also with a one-class suppot vector machine, Gaussian mixture model, and autoencoder, which are representative semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms. To train and evaluate models, we used PHR data comprised of medical check-up, life-log, and genetic testing data, and defined as the target variables six chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes). We found the proposed normalizing flow model to outperform the other tested models when used on an extremely imbalanced class. We further demonstrated that classification models with class weights performed poorly in scenarios with low base rate regardless of a biological context, unlike the proposed normalizing flow model.

## Datasets
The data underlying this article cannot be shared publicly due to the privacy of individuals that participated in the study.

## Code Organization
- constant.py: Usuful constants including key hyperparameters
- main.py: Execution of an overall process
- model_flow.py: Implementation of the architecture of normalizing flow
- train.py: Data preparation and train of the model
- utils.py: Defines CustomCosineAnnealingWarmUpRestarts.

## Installation
First of all, we recommend to use [Pytorch docker](https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorch/pytorch/1.10.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime/images/sha256-cf9197f9321ac3f49276633b4e78c79aa55f22578de3b650b3158ce6e3481f61?context=explore) if possible. Note that you need to install git for installation of FrEIA. (apt update => apt install git-all)

These two packages might be critical to execute our code.
- pytorch: 1.10.0 (cuda 11.3)
- [FrEIA](https://github.com/vislearn/FrEIA/commit/76a7d0ac82b07851582e4b0731b2f325a31b4c1d)

The all necessary packages can be installed with:
```
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
- --seed: Fixs seed as the number (Default: 0)
- --use-altub: Operates [AltUB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14913). An option depending on properties of a dataset.
- --eval-all: Evaluates for every possible test set. Being highly time-consuming, not recommended generally.
- --category: Defines a target (a type of disease)

Run the code like:
```
python3 main.py --data data/phr_data.csv --seed 0 --use-altub --eval-all --category diabetes
```
